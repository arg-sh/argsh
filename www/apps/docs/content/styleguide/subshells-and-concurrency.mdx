### Subshell

You launch a subshell by putting a command in parentheses. The subshell will have its own environment, and any changes to the environment will not affect the parent shell.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

main() {
  local var=123
  (
    echo "This is a subshell, a forked process"
    echo "The environment is a copy from the parent process"
    echo "I have access to var: ${var}"

    export MYVAR=123
    echo "MYVAR is ${MYVAR}"
  )
  echo "MYVAR is empty: ${MYVAR}"
}
main
```

### Pipelines

A pipeline is a sequence of one or more commands separated by the pipe operator `|`. The standard output of the first command is connected to the standard input of the second command.

:::warn
The shell creates a subshell for each command in the pipeline.
:::

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

main() {
  local name
  # note 'exit' does not terminate the script, it only terminates the subshell
  # note we use '{ ... }' to group the commands, to demontrate that anything in the pipeline is a subshell
  # so '{ ... }' acts the same as '( ... )' in this case
  echo "Smith" | { name="$(cat)"; echo "Hello, ${name}"; exit 0; }

  echo "name is still empty: ${name}"
}
main
```

:::note
If you want to run a command in a subshell, always use parentheses `( ... )`.
:::

### async ala subprocess

You can run commands in the background by appending an ampersand `&` to the command. The shell will create a subshell to run the command.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

main() {
  echo "This is the main process"
  ( 
    sleep 5
    echo "Done sleeping"
  ) &
  echo "This is the main process again"
}
main
```

You will note that the main process seems finished as you land on your shell. But after 5 seconds, the subshell will finish and print `Done sleeping`.

### wait

You can wait for a background process to finish by using the `wait` command. The `wait` command will wait for all background processes to finish.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

main() {
  echo "This is the main process"
  ( 
    sleep 5
    echo "Done sleeping"
  ) &
  echo "This is the main process again"
  wait
  echo "All background processes are done"
}
main
```

### Use named pipes instead of coprocesses

Coprocesses (coproc) were introduced in Bash 4.0 but are [tricky to use](https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/86372/337336).

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

main() {
  local -r fifo="$(mktemp -u)"
  mkfifo "${fifo}"

  # start a background process to read from the fifo
  (
    while read -r line; do
      echo "Received: ${line}"
    done < "${fifo}"
  ) &

  # write to the fifo
  echo "Hello" > "${fifo}"
  echo "World" > "${fifo}"

  # close the fifo
  rm -f "${fifo}"
}
main
```

### Gnerate worker processes

You can use a loop to generate worker processes. This is useful when you want to run a command multiple times in parallel.

```bash

#!/usr/bin/env bash
main() {
  local -r fifo="$(mktemp -u)"
  mkfifo "${fifo}"

  # start a background process to read from the fifo
  while [[ -p "${fifo}" ]]; do 
    cat "${fifo}"
  done &

  # write to the fifo
  local -a jobs=()
  for i in {1..10}; do (
    echo "Hello ${i}" > "${fifo}"
    # close the fifo after 10 writes
    (( i != 10 )) || exec {fifo}>&-
  ) & 
  jobs+=(${!})
  done

  # wait for all background processes to finish
  wait "${jobs[@]}" &>/dev/null
  rm -f "${fifo}"
}
main
```
