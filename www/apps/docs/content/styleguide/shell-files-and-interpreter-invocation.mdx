### File Extensions

Executables should have no extension (strongly preferred) or a
`.sh` extension. Libraries must have a `.sh`
extension and should not be executable.

It is not necessary to know what language a program is written in when
executing it and shell doesn't require an extension so we prefer not
to use one for executables.

However, for libraries it's important to know what language it is and
sometimes there's a need to have similar libraries in different
languages. This allows library files with identical purposes but
different languages to be identically named except for the
language-specific suffix.

### SUID/SGID

SUID and SGID are *forbidden* on shell scripts.

There are too many security issues with shell that make it nearly
impossible to secure sufficiently to allow SUID/SGID. While bash does
make it difficult to run SUID, it's still possible on some platforms
which is why we're being explicit about banning it.

Use `sudo` to provide elevated access if you need it.
