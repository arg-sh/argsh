### File Header

Start each file with a description of its contents.

Every file must have a top-level comment including a brief overview of
its contents. A
copyright notice
and author information are optional.

Example:

```shell
#!/bin/bash
#
# Perform hot backups of Oracle databases.
```

### Function Comments

Any function that is not both obvious and short must be commented. Any
function in a library must be commented regardless of length or
complexity.

It should be possible for someone else to learn how to use your
program or to use a function in your library by reading the comments
(and self-help, if provided) without reading the code.

All function comments should describe the intended API behaviour using:

*   Description of the function.
*   Globals: List of global variables used and modified.
*   Arguments: Arguments taken.
*   Outputs: Output to STDOUT or STDERR.
*   Returns: Returned values other than the default exit status of the
    last command run.

Example:

```shell
#######################################
# Cleanup files from the backup directory.
# Globals:
#   BACKUP_DIR
#   ORACLE_SID
# Arguments:
#   None
#######################################
function cleanup() {
  â€¦
}

#######################################
# Get configuration directory.
# Globals:
#   SOMEDIR
# Arguments:
#   None
# Outputs:
#   Writes location to stdout
#######################################
function get_dir() {
  echo "${SOMEDIR}"
}

#######################################
# Delete a file in a sophisticated manner.
# Arguments:
#   File to delete, a path.
# Returns:
#   0 if thing was deleted, non-zero on error.
#######################################
function del_thing() {
  rm "$1"
}
```

### Implementation Comments

Comment tricky, non-obvious, interesting or important parts of your
code.

This follows general Google coding comment practice. Don't comment
everything. If there's a complex algorithm or you're doing something
out of the ordinary, put a short comment in.

### TODO Comments

Use TODO comments for code that is temporary, a short-term solution, or
good-enough but not perfect.

This matches the convention in the [C++ Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#TODO_Comments).

`TODO`s should include the string `TODO` in all
caps, followed by the name, e-mail address, or other identifier of the person
with the best context about the problem referenced by
the `TODO`. The main purpose is to have a consistent
`TODO` that can be searched to find out how to get more
details upon request. A `TODO` is not a commitment that the
person referenced will fix the problem. Thus when you create a
`TODO` , it is
almost always your
name that is given.

Examples:

```shell
# TODO(mrmonkey): Handle the unlikely edge cases (bug ####)
```
