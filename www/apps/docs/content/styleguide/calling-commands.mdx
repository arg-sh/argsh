### Checking Return Values

Always check return values and give informative return values.

For unpiped commands, use `$?` or check directly via an
`if` statement to keep it simple.

Example:

```shell
if ! mv "${file_list[@]}" "${dest_dir}/"; then
  echo "Unable to move ${file_list[*]} to ${dest_dir}" >&2
  exit 1
fi

# Or
mv "${file_list[@]}" "${dest_dir}/"
if (( $? != 0 )); then
  echo "Unable to move ${file_list[*]} to ${dest_dir}" >&2
  exit 1
fi
```

Bash also has the `PIPESTATUS` variable that allows
checking of the return code from all parts of a pipe. If it's only
necessary to check success or failure of the whole pipe, then the
following is acceptable:

```shell
tar -cf - ./* | ( cd "${dir}" && tar -xf - )
if (( PIPESTATUS[0] != 0 || PIPESTATUS[1] != 0 )); then
  echo "Unable to tar files to ${dir}" >&2
fi
```

However, as `PIPESTATUS` will be overwritten as soon as you
do any other command, if you need to act differently on errors based
on where it happened in the pipe, you'll need to assign
`PIPESTATUS` to another variable immediately after running
the command (don't forget that `[` is a command and will
wipe out `PIPESTATUS`).

```shell
tar -cf - ./* | ( cd "${DIR}" && tar -xf - )
return_codes=( "${PIPESTATUS[@]}" )
if (( return_codes[0] != 0 )); then
  do_something
fi
if (( return_codes[1] != 0 )); then
  do_something_else
fi
```

### Builtin Commands vs. External Commands

Given the choice between invoking a shell builtin and invoking a
separate process, choose the builtin.

We prefer the use of builtins such as the *Parameter Expansion*
functions in `bash(1)` as it's more robust and portable
(especially when compared to things like `sed`).

Examples:

```shell
# Prefer this:
addition=$(( X + Y ))
substitution="${string/#foo/bar}"
```

```shell
# Instead of this:
addition="$(expr "${X}" + "${Y}")"
substitution="$(echo "${string}" | sed -e 's/^foo/bar/')"
```
