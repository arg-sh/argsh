# tldr

This document is a brief overview how to structure your bash scripts. To get a more detailed explanation (e.g. arrays, subprocesses, etc.), please read the [Styleguide](index.mdx).

## Shebang

The first line of your script should be the shebang. This is the line that tells the system what interpreter to use to run the script. Always use `#!/usr/bin/env bash` instead of `#!/bin/bash` or `#!/usr/bin/bash` because it's more portable.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
```

## Strict mode

The strict mode is a set of options that make the script more robust and less error-prone. It's a good practice to always use it.

```bash
set -euo pipefail
```

## Environment variables

If you have any environment variables that your script depends on, define/show them at the top of the script.

```bash
: "${LOG_LEVEL:="info"}"
: "${LOG_ENABLED}"
```

Use `:=` to provide a default value for the variable. If don't want that the variable can be set by the user, and is only used internally, declare them directly. If these are imutable, use `readonly` to make them readonly.

```bash
LOG_LEVEL="info"
readonly LOG_LEVEL
```

::: note

If you want to use the `LOG_LEVEL` in sub processes, you have to export it with `export LOG_LEVEL`.

:::

## Constants

If you have any constants, define them at the top of the script.

```bash
readonly path="${BASH_SOURCE[0]%/*}"
```

## Sourcing

If you have any functions or other scripts that you want to use in your script, source them at the top of the script.

```bash
source "${path}/functions.sh"
```

## Functions

Define your functions after the constants and sourcing. This makes it easier to find the main part of the script.

```bash
hello_world() {
  local name="${1:-world}"
  echo "Hello, ${name}!"
}
```

Declare your function parameters with `local` to make them local to the function. You may use `-r` to make them readonly.
Use `:-` to provide a default value for the parameter.

### Namespacing

If you have a lot of functions, you can namespace them by using a prefix.

```bash
to::boolean() {
  local -r value="${1}"
  case "${value}" in
    false|no|0) return 1 ;;
    * ) return 0 ;;
  esac
}

main() {
  if to::boolean "${LOG_ENABLED}"; then
    echo "Logging is enabled"
  else
    echo "Logging is disabled"
  fi
}
```

## Variables and name conventions

Use lowercase for variable names. Use `_` to separate words. Enclose the variable name in `${}` to make it clear where the variable name starts and ends. Additionally, this makes it easier to use Bash expansions.

## External commands

Try to avoid external commands like `grep`, `awk`, `sed`, etc. Use Bash builtins instead, fall back to [coreutils](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/) if necessary.
If you are using external commands, make sure to check if they are available or provide them (e.g. with the `binary` library).

```bash
if ! command -v jq &> /dev/null; then
  echo "jq could not be found"
  exit 1
fi
```

## Test expressions

Use `[[` instead of `[` for test expressions. It's more powerful and has less surprises. Use arithmetic expressions `((` for arithmetic operations/tests.

```bash
local check=1

(( check == 1 )) || {
  echo "Check failed"
  exit 1
}
```

:::note

If you use assert like checks, make sure to use `||` instead of `&&` to make the script not fail if the check fails.
`[[ <expr to be true or ...> ]] || { echo "do something else"; }`

:::

## Main

The main part of the script should be at the bottom of the script. This is where you call the functions and do the work.

```bash
main() {
  echo "Hello, world!"
}
```

## Call main

Call the main function at the bottom of the script. Check if the script is being run directly or sourced.

```bash
[[ "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" != "${0}" ]] || main "${@}"
```
