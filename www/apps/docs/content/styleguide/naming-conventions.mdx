### Function Names

Lower-case, with underscores to separate words. Separate libraries with
`::`. Parentheses are required after the function name. The
keyword `function` is optional, but must be used consistently
throughout a project.

If you're writing single functions, use lowercase and separate words
with underscore. If you're writing a package, separate package names
with `::`. Braces must be on the same line as the function
name (as with other languages at Google) and no space between the
function name and the parenthesis.

```shell
# Single function
my_func() {
  …
}

# Part of a package
mypackage::my_func() {
  …
}
```

The `function` keyword is extraneous when "()" is present
after the function name, but enhances quick identification of
functions.

Functions which can only be called from a specific context, 
depend on a variable from the parent scope, should be named with a leading ":".


### Variable Names

As for function names.

Variables names for loops should be similarly named for any variable
you're looping through.

```shell
for zone in "${zones[@]}"; do
  something_with "${zone}"
done
```

### Constants and Environment Variable Names

All caps, separated with underscores, declared at the top of the file.

Constants and anything exported to the environment should be
capitalized.

```shell
# Constant
readonly PATH_TO_FILES='/some/path'

# Both constant and environment
declare -xr ORACLE_SID='PROD'
```

Some things become constant at their first setting (for example, via
getopts). Thus, it's OK to set a constant in getopts or based on a
condition, but it should be made readonly immediately afterwards.
For the sake of clarity `readonly` or `export` is
recommended instead of the equivalent `declare` commands.

```shell
VERBOSE='false'
while getopts 'v' flag; do
  case "${flag}" in
    v) VERBOSE='true' ;;
  esac
done
readonly VERBOSE
```

### Source Filenames

Lowercase, with underscores to separate words if desired.

This is for consistency with other code styles in Google:
`maketemplate` or `make_template` but not
`make-template`.

### Read-only Variables

Use `readonly` or `declare -r` to ensure they're
read only.

As globals are widely used in shell, it's important to catch errors
when working with them. When you declare a variable that is meant to
be read-only, make this explicit.

```shell
zip_version="$(dpkg --status zip | grep Version: | cut -d ' ' -f 2)"
if [[ -z "${zip_version}" ]]; then
  error_message
else
  readonly zip_version
fi
```

### Use Local Variables

Declare function-specific variables with `local`. Declaration
and assignment should be on different lines.

Ensure that local variables are only seen inside a function and its
children by using `local` when declaring them. This avoids
polluting the global name space and inadvertently setting variables
that may have significance outside the function.

Declaration and assignment must be separate statements when the
assignment value is provided by a command substitution; as the
`local` builtin does not propagate the exit code from the
command substitution.

```shell
my_func2() {
  local name="$1"

  # Separate lines for declaration and assignment:
  local my_var
  my_var="$(my_func)"
  (( $? == 0 )) || return

  …
}
```

```shell
my_func2() {
  # DO NOT do this:
  # $? will always be zero, as it contains the exit code of 'local', not my_func
  local my_var="$(my_func)"
  (( $? == 0 )) || return

  …
}
```

### Function Location

Put all functions together in the file just below constants. Don't hide
executable code between functions. Doing so makes the code difficult to follow
and results in nasty surprises when debugging.

If you've got functions, put them all together near the top of the
file. Only includes, `set` statements and setting constants
may be done before declaring functions.

<a id="s7.8-main"></a>

### main

A function called `main` is required for scripts long enough
to contain at least one other function.

In order to easily find the start of the program, put the main program
in a function called `main` as the bottom most function.
This provides consistency with the rest of the code base as well as
allowing you to define more variables as `local` (which
can't be done if the main code is not a function). The last
non-comment line in the file should be a call to `main`:

```shell
main "$@"
```

Obviously, for short scripts where it's just a linear flow,
`main` is overkill and so is not required.
