# How to be covered

In this document, youâ€™ll learn about code coverage and how to use it in your Bash scripts.

## Introduction

Code coverage is a metric that measures the percentage of your code that is executed during testing. It helps you to identify untested code and to ensure that your tests are comprehensive.

There are different tools for measuring code coverage in Bash scripts. The most popular is [kcov](https://simonkagstrom.github.io/kcov/).

## Use kcov with argsh

Argsh provides a wrapper for kcov that you can use in your projects. If you [installed argsh](../../getting-started#project-based) as executable, you can use it like this:

```bash
argsh coverage ./scripts -o ./coverage-output
```

Use `argsh coverage --help` to get more information about the available options.

## Show your coverage in your README

You can use [shields.io](https://shields.io/) to show your code coverage in your README. You can use the following URL to generate a badge for your coverage, assuming that you have your coverage report in the `coverage` directory:

```html
<img alt="Coverage" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/dynamic/json?style=for-the-badge&logo=gnubash&color=F2CDCD&logoColor=D9E0EE&labelColor=302D41&url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2<GITHUB_ORG>%2F<GITHUB_REPO>%2Fmain%2Fcoverage%2Fcoverage.json&query=%24.percent_covered&label=Coverage&suffix=%25"/>
```

Replace `<GITHUB_ORG>` and `<GITHUB_REPO>` with your GitHub organization and repository name. There are also other options available for customizing the badge. Check out the [shields.io documentation](https://shields.io/badges/dynamic-json-badge) for more information.
