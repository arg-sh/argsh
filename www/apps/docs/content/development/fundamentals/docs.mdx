# How to Write Documentation

In this document, youâ€™ll learn about how generate documentation for your Bash scripts.

## Introduction

Documentation is an important part of software development. It helps you to communicate your ideas, to explain how your code works, and to help others to understand and use your code.

We use a modified version of [shdoc](https://github.com/reconquest/shdoc) to generate documentation for our scripts. It is a simple and easy-to-use tool that generates documentation from comments in your script.

:::note
The argsh [library](../../libraries/overview) is generated with shdoc.

## Writing Documentation

Have a look at the [shdoc documentation](https://github.com/reconquest/shdoc) to learn how to write documentation for your scripts.

## Generating Documentation

To generate documentation for your scripts, you can use the `argsh doc` command. If you [installed argsh](../../getting-started#project-based) as executable, you can use it like this:

```bash
argsh docs scripts/*.sh ./docs
```

Use `argsh doc --help` to get more information about the available options.

### Prefix

You have the ability to add a prefix to each generated file. `argsh` will look into the output directory if there is a file named `_prefix.mdx` and use it as a prefix for the generated files.
