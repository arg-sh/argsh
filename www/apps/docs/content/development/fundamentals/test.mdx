# How to Test with argsh

In this document, you'll get an overview of how to test your argsh scripts.

## Overview

Testing is an important part of software development. It helps you to ensure that your code works as expected and that it continues to work as expected when you make changes to it.

There are different types of tests, but in this document, we'll focus on unit tests and integration tests.

## Testing Frameworks

There are different testing frameworks for bash. The most popular ones are [bats](https://bats-core.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). This is what argsh is using for testing.

## Writing Tests

Every script should have a corresponding test file. The test file should be in the same directory as the script and should have the same name as the script, but with a `.bats` extension.

## Easy Testing with argsh

Argsh provides `bats` within its docker container. You can use it to run your tests.

```bash
argsh test scripts/*.sh
```

Use `argsh test --help` to get more information about the available options.

### Bats helper

Argsh provides a helper function that you can use in your tests. If you [bootstrapped your project](../../getting-started#bootstrap), you already have it in your project.

If not you can add it to your project like this:

```bash
mkdir test
curl -sSL https://test.arg.sh > test/helper.bash
```

#### load_source

The `load_source` function is used to load the source file that you want to test. It automatically loads the source file (script name with `.sh` extension).

```bash
load_source
```

:::note
If the environment variable `BATS_LOAD` is present it will load the source file from the given path. This is useful if you want to test your [minified](./minify) version of your script.
:::

#### stdout, stderr and status

The `stdout`, `stderr` and `status` variables are set before each test. You can use them to check the output of your script.

```bash
@test "Test my_script" {
  (
    main
  ) >"${stdout}" 2>"${stderr}" || status=${?}
```

#### is_empty and snapshot

The `is_empty` function checks if the given variable is empty. The `snapshot` function checks if the given variable is equal to the expected value.

```bash
  is_empty stderr
  snapshot stdout
```

:::note
`load_source` does also setup a environment variable `PATH_FIXTURES` that points to `./test/fixtures/<script name>/`.
`snapshot` will use this path to create its snapshot files.
:::

#### assert

The `assert` function is used to check expressions. It makes the output more readable.

```bash
  assert "${status}" -eq 0
}
```

### Examples

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bats

load ../test/helper.bash
load_source

@test "Test my_script" {
  (
    main
  ) >"${stdout}" 2>"${stderr}" || status=${?}

  assert "${status}" -eq 0
  is_empty stderr
  snapshot stdout
}
```

## Examples

Argsh is using bats for testing. You can have a look at the [tests](https://github.com/arg-sh/argsh/tree/main/libraries) in the argsh repository to see how it's done.
