# How to Lint your scripts

In this document, youâ€™ll learn about the best practices for linting your scripts.

## Introduction

Linting is the process of checking your scripts for errors and potential problems. It helps you to ensure that your scripts are consistent, readable, and maintainable.

There are different tools for linting bash scripts. The most popular is [shellcheck](https://www.shellcheck.net/).

:::note
At one point, we plan to extend shellcheck with a custom set of rules that are specific to argsh [styleguide](../../styleguide).

## VSCode Integration

You can integrate shellcheck into VSCode by installing the [shellcheck extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=timonwong.shellcheck).

## Use shellcheck with argsh

Argsh provides a wrapper for shellcheck that you can use in your projects. If you [installed argsh](../../getting-started#project-based) as executable, you can use it like this:

```bash
argsh lint scripts/*.sh hack/*.sh other-folder
```

Use `argsh lint --help` to get more information about the available options.
