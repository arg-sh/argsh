# Setup argsh

There are three ways to setup argsh:
- **Install argsh (globally)**: It will install argsh (globally), so you can use it from anywhere.
- **Source argsh in your shell**: Source argsh in your Bash script as a library.
- **Just copy parts of argsh**: You can just copy the parts of argsh that you need and use them in your script.

## Install argsh (globally)

You can install argsh globally by running the following command:

```bash
curl -sL https://get.arg.sh | sudo tee /usr/local/bin/argsh > /dev/null
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/argsh
```
You can also install argsh project based using [direnv](https://direnv.net/).
The recommended pattern is to have a directory `.bin` in your project root and add it to your `PATH` using direnv.

```bash
curl -sL https://get.arg.sh > .bin/argsh
chmod +x .bin/argsh
```

Check out [this .envrc file](https://github.com/arg-sh/argsh/blob/main/.envrc) for an example/template.

::: tip
If you want to quickly bootstrap a new project with argsh

```bash
bash -c "$(curl -sL https://all.arg.sh)"
```
:::

Within your Bash script, you can use argsh then like this:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env argsh
# vim: filetype=bash
```

## Source argsh in your shell

You can source argsh in your Bash script.

```bash
curl -sL https://get.arg.sh > argsh.sh
```

Then, in your script, you can source it like this:

```bash
source argsh.sh
```

## Just copy parts of argsh

Goto the [library overview](./libraries/overview) and copy the parts of argsh that you need and use them in your script.
