# Setup argsh

There are three ways to setup argsh:
- **Install argsh (globally)**: It will install argsh (globally), so you can use it from anywhere.
- **Source argsh in your shell**: Source argsh in your Bash script as a library.
- **Just copy parts of argsh**: You can just copy the parts of argsh that you need and use them in your script.

## Install argsh (globally)

This method allows you to load argsh easily via a shebang in your script.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env argsh
# shellcheck shell=bash
# vim: filetype=bash
```

Also the `argsh` script is a wrapper around the `argsh` docker image. 
This gives you the ability to use the following options to help you to write nice scripts:

- [test](/development/fundamentals/test) - Run the tests for your script
- [lint](/development/fundamentals/lint) - Lint your script
- [docs](/development/fundamentals/docs) - Generate documentation for your script
- [coverage](/development/fundamentals/coverage) - Generate a coverage report
- [minify](/development/fundamentals/minify) - Minify your script (experimental)

:::note
If you use `argsh` as executer (shebang) you have to include `${ARGSH_SOURCE}` in the call check.
```bash
[[ "${0}" != "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" && -z "${ARGSH_SOURCE:-}" ]] || main "${@}"
```
:::

### Globally

You can install argsh globally by running the following command:

```bash
curl -sL https://min.arg.sh | sudo tee /usr/local/bin/argsh > /dev/null
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/argsh
```

### Project based

You can also install argsh project based using [direnv](https://direnv.net/).
The recommended pattern is to have a directory `.bin` in your project root and add it to your `PATH` using direnv.

```bash
curl -sL https://min.arg.sh > .bin/argsh
chmod +x .bin/argsh
```

### Bootstrap a new project

If you want to quickly bootstrap a new project with argsh just do this

```bash
bash -c "$(curl -sL https://get.arg.sh)"
```

This will setup

- a `.bin` directory in your project root with argsh
- a `test` to help you get started with testing
- a `scripts` directory with an example script and test
- a `.github/workflows` directory with a GitHub Actions workflow
- a `.envrc` to initialize your environment

## Source argsh in your shell

You can source argsh in your Bash script.

```bash
curl -sL https://get.arg.sh > argsh.sh
```

Then, in your script, you can source it like this:

```bash
source argsh.sh
```

## Just copy parts of argsh

Go to the [library overview](/libraries/overview) and copy the parts of argsh that you need and use them in your script.
