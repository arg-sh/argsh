# Introduction 

Argsh consists of a set of tools that help you to build not only beautiful but powerful command-line interfaces (CLIs) for your applications but also to help you with good code quality and maintainability.

## Core Features

Argsh [library](../libraries/overview) in itself consists of Bash code snippets that you can use in your scripts. Within these snippets you also find the [command-line parser](./fundamentals/command-line-parser).

Additionally argsh provides a collection of widely used projects around Bash scripting. These are conveniently packed into a single Docker image. The `argsh` script is the entry point to this image.

You can always check what is available by running `argsh --help`.
