# AI Integration

argsh scripts are AI-native by design. The same `:usage` and `:args` declarations that power help text and shell completion also generate machine-readable tool definitions for LLMs. No glue code, no manual schema maintenance.

## Two modes of operation

| Mode | Command | What it does |
|------|---------|--------------|
| **Static schemas** | `docgen llm claude` | JSON tool arrays you feed into API calls |
| **Live MCP server** | `mcp` | Stdio JSON-RPC server that AI agents connect to directly |

Both derive their tool definitions from the same source — your script's `:usage` and `:args` declarations are the single source of truth.

### Static schemas (`docgen llm`)

Generate ready-to-use tool definitions for Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini, or Kimi. Pipe the output into your agent framework or commit it to your repo for CI.

```bash
./myapp docgen llm claude > tools.json
```

### Live MCP server (`mcp`)

Turn your script into a [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server. Claude Code, Cursor, Claude Desktop, and other MCP clients can discover and invoke your commands directly.

```bash
./myapp mcp
```

No Python, no Node.js wrappers — one command and your CLI is a live tool server.
